# saper2017
Saper made in 2017 with python 3.4

One of very first projects done in python with GUI (obviously for fun).

You need tkinter (https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html) and pillow (https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html):


You can run saper.exe on Windows.

TODO:
- total cleanup of code
- better logic
- better "starting" game to refresh it faster (probably not recreating all buttons will be a better idea :) )
- polish -> english names
